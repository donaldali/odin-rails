# Odin Flickr

Working with a third-party API (the Flickr API), for Project 2 of The Odin Project's [Projects: Building and Using APIs](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/apis).

This app uses the `Flickraw` gem to interact with the Flickr API but loosely follows the [Pixellated Visions tutorial](http://www.pixellatedvisions.com/2009/04/06/integrating-flickr-into-your-rails-website).  Photos associated with a Flickr ID are displayed responsively.
