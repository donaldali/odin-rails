# Micro-Reddit

A bare Rails application to work on the basics of Active Record for the `Micro-Reddit` project of The Odin Project's [Projects: Active Record Basics](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-with-active-record).

All work for this project was done in the `app/models` and `db/migrate` folders.  Three models (`User`, `Post`, and `Comment`) were created, and database migrations were created and run for each model. Also, the models were validated and associations were made between the models.

There are no controllers or views for this project; the `rails console` was used as a sandbox to gain familiarity with various aspects of Active Record models.
